                    There are many different games played in CAP. Players are encouraged to innovate.<br>
                    When designing new games, the following principles generally apply:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Must be playable with a single complete 52 card deck.</li>
                    <li>Games you can play online are not allowed.</li>
                    <li>Encourages action. This can be achieved by keeping equities close, and encouraging betting.</li>
                    <li>Try not to make things too complicated.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    It is often an objective to use as many cards from the deck as possible.<br>
                    This is usually achieved by dealing out as many hold cards preflop as the deck and game structure will allow.

                            In some cases, cards that will be undealt after the river are added to the discard pile to increase the likelihood of ESG.

                <h2>Point Types</h2>
                <p>Points can be divided along two dimensions – board point vs hand point, and high point vs low point. It is much more common for hand points to be high points than low points.</p>

                        <p>These are points made using the players' hold cards. These are usually, but not always, five-card hands.</p>

                        <p>These points are awarded to the best traditional high hand, either on a board or in the player’s hand. In some games, notably allocation games, a point is awarded to the best high hand using less than five cards. Straights and flushes may or may not be allowed.</p>
